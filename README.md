# Real-Time Fire Detection Alert System

This project implements a real-time fire detection alert system that sends notifications via Gmail. The system uses the YOLOv8 model for fire detection, and the model was trained on a custom dataset available on Roboflow.

## Features

- Real-time fire detection
- Email alerts through Gmail
- Trained using YOLOv8

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the fire detection model is available on Roboflow:
[Fire Detection Dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/rehman-2vlay/fire-detection-vdtmc)

## Model Training

The model was trained using Google Colab. You can find the Colab notebook for training the model here:
